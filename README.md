This repository contains the project "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" as part of the curriculum of the Holberton School. The project focuses on implementing stacks and queues in C, exploring the concepts of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures.

## Project Description

The project "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" involves the implementation of stacks and queues in the C programming language. It covers various concepts related to stacks, queues, and their operations, as well as the creation of a custom interpreter for a stack-based language called Monty.

## Contents

This repository contains:

- Source code for the project's C implementations.
- Monty interpreter source code.
- Brainf*ck scripts for arithmetic operations.
- Bytecode files for testing the Monty interpreter.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `/`: Root directory containing the main README and project files.
- `/bf`: Directory containing Brainf*ck scripts.
- `/bytecodes`: Directory containing bytecode files for Monty interpreter.
- `/src`: Directory containing source code for the project.
- `/src/monty.h`: Header file containing data structures and function prototypes.
- `/src/monty_main.c`: Main entry point for the Monty interpreter.
- `/src/monty_operations.c`: Implementation of Monty opcodes.
- ...

## How to Use

To run the Monty interpreter, compile the source code using the provided Makefile:

```bash
$ make monty
Then, run the interpreter with the desired Monty bytecode file:

bash
Copy code
$ ./monty bytecodes/sample.m
You can also run the Brainf*ck scripts:

bash
Copy code
$ bf bf/1001-add.bf
